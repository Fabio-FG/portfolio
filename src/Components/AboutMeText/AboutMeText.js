      <p>
        I am a Web Developer based in Lisbon, Portugal. I first started to deal
        with the world of tech in 2014 when I did a multimedia course in Lisbon.
        Although I did not pursue a career in the big world of tech at the time
        I was always keeping an eye on it and after completing a bachelor's and
        a master's degree in Translation I decided to completely change my life
        around.
      </p>
      <br></br> In 2020 I started to play with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I
      became addicted on how things worked and on how I could learn more. After
      that, in 2021, I completed a Full Stack Web Development course focused on
      the MERN stack and my goal for the future is to combine technology with
      beautiful designs and aesthetics.
