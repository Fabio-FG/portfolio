           <p> I first started to deal with the world of tech in 2014 when I did a
            multimedia course in Lisbon. Although I did not pursue a career in
            the big world of tech at the time I was always keeping an eye on it
            and after completing a bachelor's and a master's degree in
            Translation I decided to completely change my life around.
            </p>
            <br></br> In 2020 I started to dabble with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
            and I became addicted to know more and learn how things worked. In
            2021, I completed a Full Stack Web Development course and my goal is
            is to combine technology with beautiful designs and aesthetics.{" "}
